## react-todo-functional

A simple ToDo application built with React using only functional components and no class components. This exercise was intended to explore and learn more about Hooks in React.

### Some notes about functional components in React

* Functional components are good for presentational components (components that are stateless are just UI elements)
* Functional components receive props as arguments and return JSX that is to be rendered. (We destructure the props in arguments using ES6 object destrucuturing for convenience)
* They are also easier to work with (considering you don't have to worry about `this`) and easier to understand.

Earlier, functional components were strictly stateless, but now, we can use React Hooks to implement the state functionality in functional components.
